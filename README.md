# Langton's Ant

Langton's ant is a universal Turing machine that play out on a 2D grid. It was created by Chris Langton in 1986 and is an example of complex emergent behaviour.

Emergent behaviour is described as the interactions between parts of a system and which are not inherantly predictable or determinable from the behaviour of each part individually. In this case, the behaviour is described as complex as the purpose and relation of each distinct part is not simple to determine.

Langton's ant uses two simple rules in tandem with the black and white 2D grid:
- At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.
- At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit.
